# COSI21A_PA3
You’ve just accepted a new internship at Yahoo, in a city not yet supported by Google Maps. You want to find the fastest route to the company from your house, but you don’t even have a map! All you know is that your internship probably has a Yahoo sign on its building, and that it’s on an intersection. The naïve way to find the shortest path would be to just take a direct route, but you never know if the direct route has the most traffic. Another thing you could do is try every possible path, but the run-time for that would be ridiculous (no pun intended). However, being a data structures and algorithms student, you know that you can find the shortest path from your house to the Yahoo building, even considering the traffic in the city, by using Dijikstra’s Algorithm.
